    ### UX

    #### Project Goals

    The goal of this profect is to build a website for Kerry Painters with a few 
    key pints in mind.
    The main goal is to have a responsive website that will generate more enqiries about 
    the service that Kerry Painters provides which in turn will translate into more work and oppertunities for 
    the business to grow.<br>
    I would also like to showcase the work that they do through a gallery as
    I feel when the potential customers see the work that they will be impressed.

    #### Design Choices

    * #### Fonts:
        The Fonts I chose for this project were "Abril Fatface" and "open-sans".
        I used "Abril Fatface" for the brand logo and also for headings whereas I used 
        "open-sans"
        for the other elements of the body i.e "paragraphs"

    * #### Icons: 
        The Icons I used for this were pretty basic. I got them from the 
        free version of Font Awesome. I adjusted the size and colour of them through css.

    * #### Colours:
        For the colours of the site I decided to go with 3 complimentary colours
        I used a blue #196076 a gold #BE962A and white #FFF.

    ### Wireframing
    For my wireframes I used Balsamiq. I kept it basic and made sue all the pictures I included were
     sketched to fit in with the tone of the wireframe.
