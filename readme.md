    ### UX

    #### Project Goals

    The goal of this profect is to build a website for Kerry Painters with a few 
    key pints in mind.
    The main goal is to have a responsive website that will generate more enqiries about 
    the service that Kerry Painters provides which in turn will translate into more work and oppertunities for 
    the business to grow.<br>
    I would also like to showcase the work that they do through a gallery as
    I feel when the potential customers see the work that they will be impressed.

    #### Design Choices

    * #### Fonts
        The Fonts I chose for this project were "Abril Fatface" and "open-sans".
        I used "Abril Fatface" for the brand logo and also for headings whereas I used 
        "open-sans"
        for the other elements of the body i.e "paragraphs"

    * #### Icons: 
        The Icons I used for this were pretty basic. I got them from the 
        free version of Font Awesome. I adjusted the size and colour of them through css.

    * #### Colours:
        For the colours of the site I decided to go with 3 complimentary colours
        I used a blue #196076 a gold #BE962A and white #FFF.

    ### Wireframing
    For my wireframes I used Balsamiq. I kept it basic and made sue all the pictures I included were
     sketched to fit in with the tone of the wireframe. You can view my 
     wireframes [here](https://github.com/Gertobin11/gitpod-full-template/tree/master/assets/wireframes)

    ### Technologies

    * git 
    * bootstrap
    * fontawesome
    * google Fonts
    * GIMP (for editing the kerry painters logo)
    * balsamiq (for my wireframes)

    ### Languages

    * HTML
    * CSS 
    * JS & JQuery {were used by bootstrap which I used so I downloaded the cdn for them}

    ### Features
    * A call to action buttom on the hero image which brings up a modal so potential
     customers can get a quote instantly without leaving the main page.
     * A well laid out gallery to showcase the services on offer.
     * A contact us page with a form, the site owners emil addresses and contact numbers.

    ### Future Features 
    * I would love to implement a form where the potential customer was given a choice of jobs, sizes and and paint type where upon entering they could get an instant ballpark figure quote.


    ### Testing
        * I ran my webpages through jigsaw validator and I came up with 3 errors in the website which were easil fixed, 2 were simple missed property type where I put in size instead of resize, and another was bottom-border-width: 40% , which I didnt need so I just took it out
        * I ran the web pages through W3C validator and I had one error where I put an a tag as a descendant of a button which I corrected esaily enough by placing it in a form with an action value.
        * I tested the responsiveness throughout with chromedeveloper tools and any issues I had I fixed with adjusting my bootstrap grid and columns and in css with media queries.
